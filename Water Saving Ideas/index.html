        <h1 class="title">Ways to save water in your home</h1>

        <h4 class="info">Next to air, water is the most important element for the preservation of life.Water is a
            finite commodity which, if not managed properly, will result in
            shortages in the near future. Water conservation can go a long way to help
            alleviate these impending shortages.

<img class="edge" id="toilet" src="images/toilet.png">

            <p class="ways2save">1. Check your toilet for leaks.
                Put a few drops of food coloring in your toilet tank. If,
                without flushing, the coloring begins to appear in the
                bowl, you have a leak that may be wasting more than 100
                gallons of water a day.
            </p>


            <p class="ways2save">2. Stop using your toilet as an ashtray or wastebasket.
                Every cigarette butt or tissue you flush away also flushes away five to seven
                gallons of water.
            </p>


            <p class="ways2save">3. Put a plastic bottle in your toilet tank.
                Put an inch or two of sand or pebbles in the bottom of a one liter bottle to
                weigh it down. Fill the rest of the bottle with water and put it in your toilet
                tank, safely away from the operating mechanism. In an average home, the
                bottle may save five gallons or more of water every day without harming the
                efficiency of the toilet. If your tank is big enough, you may even be able to put in two bottles</p>

                <img class="edge" id="sprinkler" src="images/sprinkler.png" alt="sprinkler">

            <p>4. Put a layer of mulch around trees and plants.
                Mulch slows the evaporation of moisture.
            </p>

            <p>5. Take baths.
                A partially filled tub uses less water than all but the shortest showers.
            </p>

            <p>6. Take shorter showers.
                A typical shower uses five to ten gallons of water a minute. Limit your
                showers to the time it takes to soap up, wash down and rise off.
            </p>

            <p>8. Check faucets and pipes for leaks.
                Leaks waste water 24 hours a day, seven days a week. An inexpensive
                washer is usually enough to stop them.
            </p>

            <p>7. Deep-soak your lawn.
                When you do water your lawn, water it long enough for water to seep down to
                the roots where it is needed. A light sprinkling that sits on the surface will
                simply evaporate and be wasted.
            </p>

            <p>9. Check faucets and pipes for leaks.
                Even a small drip can waste 50 or more gallons of water a
                day.
            </p>

            <p>10. Don't let the faucet run while you clean vegetables.
                Rinse your vegetables instead in a bowl or sink full of
                clean water.
            </p>

            <p>11. Keep a bottle of drinking water in the refrigerator.
                This puts a stop to the wasteful practice of running tap water to cool it for
                drinking.
            </p>

            <p>12. If you wash dishes by hand, don't leave the water running
                for rinsing.
                If you have two sinks, fill one with rinse water. If you have only one sink, first
                gather all your washed dishes in a dish rack, then rinse them quickly with a
                spray device or a pan of water.
            </p>

            <p class="save">13. Water your lawn only when it needs it.
                Watering on a regular schedule doesn't allow for cool
                spells or rainfall which reduce the need for watering. Step
                on some grass. If it springs back up when you move your
                foot, it doesn't need water</p>

            <p class="save">14. Use your automatic dishwasher for full loads only.
                Every time you run your dishwasher, you use about 25 gallons of water.
            </p>

            <p class="save">15. Water during the cool parts of the day.
                Early morning is better than dusk since it helps prevent the growth of fungus.
            </p>

            <p class="save">16. Don't water the gutter.
                Position your sprinklers so that water lands on your lawn or garden, not in
                areas where it does no good. Also, avoid watering on windy days when much
                of your water may be carried off to the streets and sidewalks.
            </p>

            <p>17. Install water-saving shower heads or flow restrictors.
                Your hardware or plumbing supply store stocks inexpensive shower heads or
                flow restrictors that will cut your shower flow to about three gallons a minute
                instead of five to ten. They are easy to install, and your showers will still be
                cleansing and refreshing.
            </p>

            <p>18. Use a broom to clean driveways, sidewalks and steps.
                Using a hose wastes hundreds and hundreds of gallons of water</p>

            <p>19. Don't run the hose while washing your car.
                Soap down your car from a pail of soapy water. Use a hose only to rinse it off.
            </p>

            <p>20. Tell your children not to play with the hose and
                sprinklers.
                Children love to play under a hose or sprinkler on a hot day. Unfortunately,
                this practice is extremely wasteful of precious water and should be
                discouraged.
